A simple boiled egg timer

This sketch was developed in tandem with Seeedstudio's brick system, however that system isn't needed- all that's required are the components used:

• LCD module
• Potentiometer
• Buzzer
• Pushbutton
• Thermistor (optional)

Have Fun and may your eggs be boiled to your specifications.
